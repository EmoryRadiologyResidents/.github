# Emory Radiology Resident Research Projects

This organization contains research projects created by radiology residents at Emory. This is an unofficial group that is run by current residents, and is not directly affiliated with Emory University.

We keep this organization private as it is for our residents to use. While each repository can be made public by its developers, the group itself will remain private.

If you would like to join this group, please contact Saumya Gurbani.
